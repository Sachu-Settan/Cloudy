# AI Assistant (Codename: Cloudy)

## Overview

The AI Assistant, codenamed "Cloudy," is a Python-based interactive assistant designed to assist users through conversations, perform searches, generate responses using OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model, recognize faces through webcam input, handle speech recognition, and provide audio feedback using text-to-speech capabilities.

## Features

- **Conversation Handling:** Engages in dialogues with users, processes their queries, and responds accordingly.
- **OpenAI Integration:** Interacts with OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model for generating responses based on user inputs.
- **Text-to-Speech:** Converts textual responses to audio and plays them for user feedback.
- **Google Search Query:** Utilizes Google's Custom Search API to retrieve search results based on user queries.
- **Speech Recognition:** Recognizes speech from user inputs, enabling voice-based interactions.
- **Face Recognition:** Utilizes OpenCV and face_recognition to identify users through webcam input.

## Installations: Refer [Installation.md](INSTALLATION.md)

## Usage

1. **Launch:** Run the script to start the AI assistant.
2. **Interaction:** Speak to the assistant or type queries to engage in conversations.
3. **User Recognition:** Face recognition helps identify users for personalized interactions.
4. **Voice and Text Responses:** Get audio feedback for responses and view search results.
